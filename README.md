##Solar system

Solar system project is inspired by the need to apply my current knowledge for React JS in one very basic project. 
The project has React JS for frontend and it is used public Web API for backend - https://rapidapi.com/newbAPIOfficial/api/planets-info-by-newbapi .
Used Web API gives information about all planets in the Solar system. It is described a short information about each one of the planets.

The project is made of some pages: Home, Contact, About, Planets, Error and Details (for one planet). The project covers using of React JS "hooks" (useState, useEffect, useParams), "fetch" API for the web requests, using of different components, screens, CSS styling and using of "props". It is also used routing which comes from react-router-dom library.
